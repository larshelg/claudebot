# Trading System Improvements

This document outlines potential enhancements to our real-time trading risk management system.

## 🎯 High-Impact Next Steps

### 1. Capital Adequacy & Leverage Checks ⭐️ *[Recommended First]*

**Objective:** Enforce capital limits and prevent over-leveraging

**Implementation:**
```java
// In PreTradeRiskCheckWithPolicy
if (tradeNotional > availableCapital * maxLeverage) {
    return; // Reject trade
}
```

**Changes Required:**
- Add `maxLeverage` field to AccountPolicy
- Calculate available capital vs exposure in PreTradeRiskCheckWithPolicy
- Reject trades that would exceed leverage limits
- Add portfolio-level leverage monitoring
- Create test: "Trade rejected when leverage exceeds limit"

**Business Value:** Prevents catastrophic over-leveraging, regulatory compliance

### 2. Real-time P&L Calculation ⭐️ *[High Value]*

**Objective:** Track unrealized and realized profit/loss in real-time

**Current State:** Positions track `avgPrice` but no live P&L

**Implementation:**
```java
// Add to Position domain object
public double unrealizedPnl;  // (currentPrice - avgPrice) * qty
public double realizedPnl;    // From closed trades

// Update Portfolio equity calculation
pf.equity = pf.cashBalance + pf.exposure + totalUnrealizedPnl;
```

**Changes Required:**
- Add market data stream (current prices)
- Add P&L fields to Position class
- Create P&L calculator process function
- Update PortfolioUpdater to include P&L in equity
- Add P&L-based risk alerts (drawdown limits)
- Create test: "P&L updates with market price changes"

**Business Value:** Real-time portfolio valuation, performance monitoring

---

### 3. Enhanced Risk Engine ⭐️

**Objective:** Expand beyond simple exposure limits to comprehensive risk management

**Current State:** Only checks total exposure > $1M

**Implementation:**
```java
// Multiple risk checks
public class AdvancedRiskEngine {
    - checkPortfolioHeat(correlation risk between positions)
    - checkConcentrationLimits(max % in single symbol)
    - checkDrawdownLimits(max loss from peak equity)
    - calculateVaR(value at risk based on historical data)
    - checkSectorExposure(limits per industry/sector)
}
```

**Changes Required:**
- Create comprehensive RiskMetrics class
- Add historical data tracking for VaR calculations
- Implement correlation matrix for portfolio heat
- Add sector/industry classification to symbols
- Create configurable risk limits in AccountPolicy
- Multiple risk alert types and severity levels

**Business Value:** Professional-grade risk management, regulatory compliance

---

### 4. Order Management System

**Objective:** Add proper order lifecycle management

**Current State:** Direct signals → executions (unrealistic)

**Implementation:**
```java
// Order lifecycle: Signal → Order → Execution → Position
public class Order {
    String orderId;
    String accountId; 
    String symbol;
    double qty;
    double limitPrice;
    String orderType; // MARKET, LIMIT, STOP
    String status;    // PENDING, FILLED, REJECTED, CANCELLED, PARTIAL
    long createdTime;
    long lastUpdatedTime;
}

public class OrderManager extends KeyedProcessFunction<String, TradeSignal, Order> {
    // Convert signals to orders
    // Handle order routing
    // Track order status
    // Generate executions
}
```

**Changes Required:**
- Create Order domain object
- Create OrderManager process function
- Add order status tracking
- Handle partial fills
- Add order cancellation logic
- Create order book simulation
- Update job pipeline: Signals → Orders → Executions → Positions

**Business Value:** Realistic trading simulation, better testing, order analytics

### 5. Multi-timeframe Strategy Support

**Objective:** Support multiple trading strategies running simultaneously

**Current State:** Single CEP strategy hardcoded

**Implementation:**
```java
// Strategy factory pattern
public class StrategyEngine {
    private List<TradingStrategy> strategies = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public StrategyEngine addStrategy(TradingStrategy strategy) {
        strategies.add(strategy);
        return this;
    }
}

// Usage
StrategyEngine engine = new StrategyEngine()
    .addStrategy(new RSICrossoverStrategy(14))
    .addStrategy(new MovingAverageCrossover(50, 200))
    .addStrategy(new SevenGreenCandlesStrategy())
    .addStrategy(new MomentumStrategy(20));
```

**Changes Required:**
- Create TradingStrategy interface
- Implement strategy factory pattern
- Add strategy-specific parameters and configuration
- Handle conflicting signals from multiple strategies
- Add strategy performance tracking
- Create strategy allocation/weighting system

**Business Value:** Diversified trading approaches, strategy comparison, reduced single-strategy risk

---

### 6. Market Data Integration

**Objective:** Connect to real market data feeds

**Current State:** Static test data only

**Implementation:**
```java
public class MarketDataConnector {
    // WebSocket connections to exchanges
    // Price feed normalization
    // Market data validation
    // Latency monitoring
}
```

**Changes Required:**
- Add market data stream connectors (WebSocket, REST APIs)
- Implement data validation and cleaning
- Add market session handling (pre-market, regular, after-hours)
- Handle connection failures and reconnection logic
- Add market data quality monitoring

**Business Value:** Real trading capability, live market validation

---

### 7. Performance Monitoring & Observability

**Objective:** Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting

**Implementation:**
```java
// Metrics collection
- Trade execution latency
- Risk check processing time  
- Position update frequency
- Portfolio calculation performance
- Alert generation rates
- System throughput (trades/second)
```

**Changes Required:**
- Add Prometheus metrics collection
- Create Grafana dashboards
- Implement health checks
- Add distributed tracing
- Log structured events for analysis
- Set up alerting for system anomalies

**Business Value:** Production readiness, performance optimization, incident response

---

### 8. Persistence & State Management

**Objective:** Add durable storage for critical state

**Current State:** In-memory state only

**Implementation:**
```java
// State backends
- RocksDB for local state
- Database for positions/portfolios
- Event sourcing for audit trail
- Backup and recovery procedures
```

**Changes Required:**
- Configure Flink state backend
- Add database schemas for positions/portfolios
- Implement event sourcing pattern
- Add state snapshots and recovery
- Create data retention policies

**Business Value:** Data durability, audit compliance, disaster recovery
