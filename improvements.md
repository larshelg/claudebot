## Trading System Improvements

This document captures an assessment of the current trading system and a prioritized list of improvements. It reflects the latest trade engine refactor (positions, portfolio, P&L, risk) and its integration posture with Fluss.

### Overall assessment
- Architecture: 8/10
- Correctness: 7/10
- Latency/throughput: 8/10
- Resilience/ops: 6/10
- Extensibility: 9/10

### Current strengths
- Clear separation: indicators/strategies persisted to Fluss; trade engine consumes.
- Flink hot state for low-latency decisioning; Fluss for durability/history.
- Full trade lifecycle implemented: accepted → exec → positions → portfolio → P&L (realized/unrealized) → alerts.
- Latest vs. history modeling (upsert vs. append) validated with test sinks.
- FIFO matcher + realized P&L aggregation + unrealized P&L from price ticks in place.
- Dynamic `AccountPolicy` stream and keyed co-process for pre-trade checks.
- Strong test coverage and modular operators.

### Priority improvements
1) Correctness and consistency
   - Idempotence/dedup on `ExecReport` (orderId + sequence/hash) to avoid double counting.
   - Track pending exposure (accepted-but-not-filled) in pre-trade checks.
   - Formalize position/P&L conventions (crossing, avg price reset, shorting semantics) and encode tests.
   - Watermarks/event-time alignment for exec/price; lateness/OOO configuration.

2) Fluss integration
   - Wire real sources/sinks to tables in `data/trading_storage.sql`.
   - Upsert latest: `open_positions_latest`, `realized_pnl_latest`, `unrealized_pnl_latest`, `portfolio_latest`.
   - Append history: `exec_report_history`, `trade_match_history`, `position_close_history`, `risk_alerts`.
   - Ensure keys/PKs match job keys; define schema versioning and backfill/CDC story.

3) State bootstrap and replay
   - On startup, rehydrate hot state from Fluss latest tables; gate trade intake until bootstrap complete.
   - Define replay policy so reprocessing exec history rebuilds latest deterministically and idempotently.

4) Pre-trade policy depth
   - Enrich `AccountPolicy` (per-symbol caps, notional/order caps, account status, margin constraints).
   - Guarantee per-account serialization across the whole trade path; include pending orders in risk.

5) Observability and SRE
   - Metrics: open positions by key, unmatched lot queue depth, match rate, realized/unrealized totals, policy update lag.
   - Alerts on anomalies: unmatched sells, negative cash, exposure spikes, late watermarks.
   - Trace/IDs: propagate tradeId/orderId across logs and sinks.

6) Performance and scaling
   - Validate key distribution (accountId|symbol) for hotspots; consider compound partitioning if needed.
   - Load tests with many accounts/symbols; verify sink throughput and operator latency under backpressure.

7) Testing
   - Golden tests for realized/unrealized under mixed long/short, crossing, partials.
   - Fault-injection: duplicate execs, out-of-order fills, late prices, restart recovery.
   - Property tests for matcher invariants (no negative unmatched after full close, conservation checks).

8) Operational safety
   - Kill-switch policy in RiskEngine (BLOCKED or margin breach halts acceptance immediately).
   - DLQ for malformed/unknown events with re-ingest workflow.
   - Data retention/compaction for history tables; tiering for long-term storage.

### Medium-term enhancements
- Use market data (not execs) as the source for unrealized P&L; make it switchable.
- Portfolio equity semantics: cash ± realized P&L ± unrealized P&L ± margin/fees; document and implement consistently.
- Strategy/trade attribution: persist `strategyId`/`runId` on orders and P&L for analytics.
- Define latency budgets and SLAs; add end-to-end timing metrics.

### Immediate next steps (test-first)
- Implement ExecReport idempotence and add duplicate-fill tests.
- Wire Fluss sinks for latest/history tables behind feature flags; keep test sinks in parallel.
- Add bootstrap-from-Fluss path and an integration test that restarts mid-stream.
- Extend metrics/logging and surface in monitoring for initial rollout.

# Trading System Improvements

This document outlines potential enhancements to our real-time trading risk management system.

## 🎯 High-Impact Next Steps

### 1. Capital Adequacy & Leverage Checks ⭐️ *[Recommended First]*

**Objective:** Enforce capital limits and prevent over-leveraging

**Implementation:**
```java
// In PreTradeRiskCheckWithPolicy
if (tradeNotional > availableCapital * maxLeverage) {
    return; // Reject trade
}
```

**Changes Required:**
- Add `maxLeverage` field to AccountPolicy
- Calculate available capital vs exposure in PreTradeRiskCheckWithPolicy
- Reject trades that would exceed leverage limits
- Add portfolio-level leverage monitoring
- Create test: "Trade rejected when leverage exceeds limit"

**Business Value:** Prevents catastrophic over-leveraging, regulatory compliance

---

### 2. Real-time P&L Calculation ⭐️ *[High Value]*

**Objective:** Track unrealized and realized profit/loss in real-time

**Current State:** Positions track `avgPrice` but no live P&L

**Implementation:**
```java
// Add to Position domain object
public double unrealizedPnl;  // (currentPrice - avgPrice) * qty
public double realizedPnl;    // From closed trades

// Update Portfolio equity calculation
pf.equity = pf.cashBalance + pf.exposure + totalUnrealizedPnl;
```

**Changes Required:**
- Add market data stream (current prices)
- Add P&L fields to Position class
- Create P&L calculator process function
- Update PortfolioUpdater to include P&L in equity
- Add P&L-based risk alerts (drawdown limits)
- Create test: "P&L updates with market price changes"

**Business Value:** Real-time portfolio valuation, performance monitoring

---

### 3. Enhanced Risk Engine ⭐️

**Objective:** Expand beyond simple exposure limits to comprehensive risk management

**Current State:** Only checks total exposure > $1M

**Implementation:**
```java
// Multiple risk checks
public class AdvancedRiskEngine {
    - checkPortfolioHeat(correlation risk between positions)
    - checkConcentrationLimits(max % in single symbol)
    - checkDrawdownLimits(max loss from peak equity)
    - calculateVaR(value at risk based on historical data)
    - checkSectorExposure(limits per industry/sector)
}
```

**Changes Required:**
- Create comprehensive RiskMetrics class
- Add historical data tracking for VaR calculations

public class Order {
    String orderId;
    String accountId;
    String symbol;
    double qty;
    double limitPrice;
    String orderType; // MARKET, LIMIT, STOP
    String status;    // PENDING, FILLED, REJECTED, CANCELLED, PARTIAL
    long createdTime;
    long lastUpdatedTime;
}

public class OrderManager extends KeyedProcessFunction<String, TradeSignal, Order> {
    // Convert signals to orders
    // Handle order routing
    // Track order status
    // Generate executions
}
```

**Changes Required:**
- Create Order domain object
- Create OrderManager process function

### 5. Multi-timeframe Strategy Support

**Objective:** Support multiple trading strategies running simultaneously

**Current State:** Single CEP strategy hardcoded

**Implementation:**
```java
// Strategy factory pattern
public class StrategyEngine {
    private List<TradingStrategy> strategies = new ArrayList<>();

    public StrategyEngine addStrategy(TradingStrategy strategy) {
        strategies.add(strategy);
        return this;
    }
}

// Usage
StrategyEngine engine = new StrategyEngine()
    .addStrategy(new RSICrossoverStrategy(14))
    .addStrategy(new MovingAverageCrossover(50, 200))
    .addStrategy(new SevenGreenCandlesStrategy())
    .addStrategy(new MomentumStrategy(20));
```

**Changes Required:**
- Create TradingStrategy interface
